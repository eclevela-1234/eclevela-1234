# Hello world!
**I am an independent data analyst/developer and double boot camp graduate (almost)! I specialize in full-stack Javascript based coding languages and also have a strong understanding of Python, SQL, VBA, Tableau (& other sorftware suites). I am seeking an opportunity to apply my skills, work ethic, business acumen and experience in a more technical role in data science or coding.**

I got into coding and analytics because I wanted to learn more about data analysis after I finished my MBA degree in 2020. Last year, I completed a Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp where I learned in-depth python and its associated libraries and platforms, plus some VBA, R, Tableau. While these concepts helped strengthen my analytical skills and overall understanding of data, I found myself wanting to create secure and usable dashboards which ultimately required a front-end. This led to my current enrollment in the Full Stack Boot Camp. My latest foray into programming has been so enriching because I am able to build on the foundational Javascript I learned last year.

I have never been more pumped about coding! I spend almost every spare moment I have putting in the hours so that I can approach the data world with confidence! I am excited about the prospect of contibuting full-time to the world of coding and data analytics!
