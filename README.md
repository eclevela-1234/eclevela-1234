# Hi there!
**I am an independent data analyst/developer and double boot camp graduate! I specialize in full-stack JavaScript based coding languages and also have a working knowledge of Python, SQL, VBA, Tableau (& other software suites). I am seeking an opportunity to apply my skills, work ethic, business acumen and experience in a more technical role in data science or coding.**

I got into coding and analytics because I wanted to learn more about data analysis after I finished my MBA degree in 2020. Last year, I completed a Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp where I learned in-depth python and its associated libraries and platforms, plus some VBA, R, Tableau. While these concepts helped strengthen my analytical skills and overall understanding of data, I found myself wanting to create secure and usable dashboards which ultimately required a full-stack. This led to my current enrollment in the Full Stack Boot Camp. My latest foray into programming has been so enriching because I am able to build on the foundational JavaScript I learned last year.
