# Hi there!

**I am a full stack web developer and data analyst leveraging retail management background to design intuitive business applications. Certificates in Full Stack Web Development and Data Analytics from the University of Richmond.** 

Proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python coding languages in a collaborative Git setting. Experience implementing SQL and MongoDB databases through object mappers in both Node and Python environments. Working knowledge of libraries such as Bootstrap, Bulma, jQuery, Plotly, and analysis tools Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKitLearn, R, and Tableau.

I set aggressive deadlines and order my days for the greatest amount of productivity. Because of this I was able to utilize instructional time for collaboration and practice. I was honored with the Book Award for the highest grades and chosen as commencement speaker for the Full Stack program. Iâ€™ve achieved career success by design thinking, always searching for intuitive ways to improve processes and enhance user experiences.    

Excited to get to work developing applications that provide a broad array of business solutions.
